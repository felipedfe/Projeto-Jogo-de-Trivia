# Trivia Game

## •Description
An application that simulates a trivia game. The user logs in on the home screen and then receives 5 questions to be answered in sequence (each of them has a correct alternative and another 3 incorrect ones). A timer counts the maximum time of 30 seconds for each question to be answered. At the end, a screen with a ranking of the best results is shown. It was developed in Redux and React using Class components. The API used was the Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).
